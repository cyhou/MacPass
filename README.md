#MacPass

There a lot of iOS KeePass tools around but a distinct lack of a good OS X Version.
KeePass can be used via Mono on OS X but lacks vital functionality and feels sluggish.

This is an attempt to create an OS X port that should at least be able to read KeePass files.

##Disclaimer

The Project is in heavy development and it's likely to take some time till it reaches a usable state.
Beware that I'm going to shift things around so stuff is going to break. A lot.

##Dowload

I'm trying to upload new builds along the way for all of you that just want to take a quick look.
As stated in the disclaimer, this software cannot be considered safe for work in it's current development status.
Use it with caution! Since I did start refactoring the KeePassLib there is even more potential broken code!

[Older Version of MacPass at Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yqgfwi7f8mnd747/NCQlJmg0f0) (build 1882 07/04/2013)

All [new Release](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/releases) are server from Github.

##Known Issues

* Undo/Redo get's messed up when the Trash (=RecylcleBin in KeePass terms) is enabled/used
* Drag and Drop in Outline/Entry View broken

##Help

I'm in constant need of a full set of Databases with all possible keyfile/password and format combinations.
If you are able to provide databases with keyfiles (Hashed, Binary, XML) I would love to hear from you!

##Requirement

MacPass needs OS X 10.8 as a minimum OS version since it takes advantage of some of the enhancements in Autolayout in 10.8.
It might be possible to target 10.7 but with the upcomming 10.9 release, I think 10.8 is a feasable minimum.

##Status

Take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/wiki/Status)

##Alternatives

Currently there is an alpha Version available of [KeePassX](http://www.keepassx.org).
It's Qt based KeePass manager, than can handle KeePass 1 and 2 containers rather nicely.
Compared to running KeePass with Mono it very fast and remarkably stable for an alpha relaese.
Feel free to give it a try. The biggest draw-back is it's inablity to create passwords via a wizzard.

##What does it look like?
